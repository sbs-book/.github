## Topic

For the past decades, a growing body of scientific studies in neuropathology, neurology, biomechanics, statistics, and psychology has cast doubt on the forensic reliability of medical determinations of Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS), also known as Abusive Head Trauma (AHT). Studies have increasingly documented that the same findings are caused not only by non-accidental trauma, but also by accidental short falls and a wide range of medical conditions. Nevertheless, inaccurate diagnoses, unrealistic confidence expression, and wrongful convictions continue to this day.

Bringing together contributions from a multidisciplinary expert panel of 32 world-leading professionals, this landmark book explains the scientific evidence challenging the reliability of determinations of SBS/AHT and advances efforts to evaluate how deaths and serious brain injuries in infants should be analysed and investigated.
